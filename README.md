# Runal with OSC

This was a quick test to show how [Runal](https://empr.cl/runal/) 
could be controlled by an OSC client on a phone. 
I used the "Osc Controller" Android app,
which has `/slider1` as the default message for the first slider.

I am having a hard time getting this to work in WSL2 since there
seem to be some hoops to jump through to get networking to work
correctly, although I don't remember this being a problem in my
past OSC experiments. In the meantime, it works just fine in 
Windows. Since my future plans will use an actual Linux box and
not WSL2, I'm not worried about these problems right now.
